-Oven Bird, by Robert Frost
+The Annoying Bird, by Robyn Lost
 
-There is a singer everyone has heard,
-Loud, a mid-summer and a mid-wood bird,
-Who makes the solid tree trunks sound again.
-He says that leaves are old and that for flowers
-Mid-summer is to spring as one to ten.
-He says the early petal-fall is past
-When pear and cherry bloom went down in show
